    - payload: Ok
      title: Ok
    text: Jumping to conclusions is one of the most common forms of negative thinking. The problem with this type of a cognitive distortion is that conclusions are in most cases negative; catastrophically negative. You usually jump to a negative conclusion without any justifiable facts of the situation or reality. In the next step, you start torturing yourself with how unlucky you are.

      title: Ok
    text: For example, a student may “fortune-tell” by assuming that the readers of his or her paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise. Another example, someone may do “mind-reading” by assuming that some group of people don’t like him/her and they make fun of him/her.
